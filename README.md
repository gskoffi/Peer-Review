Based on my project summary, it was some effort put in to create a fun and comfortable feel for my online clothing shopping website. I had the intention to add more graphic elements such as images of multiple clothing designs is a great way to engage with my customer and make them feel connected to my designer brand.
It's also great to see that I plan to add more features to the website such as a customizable design measurement to help customers verify their sizes before buying and a system for creating an account and storing previous orders. These features can greatly enhance the user experience and make ordering more convenient for my customers.
However, it's important to keep in mind that time limitations can impact the quality and completeness of the project. It's good that I acknowledged this and prepared future additions that I plan to make the website better.
Overall, it seems like I have a clear vision for the clothing shopping website and have put in the effort to create a user-friendly design. With additional time and effort, I can further enhance the website and create a more seamless user experience.
